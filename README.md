# EDA_Haberman_Dataset
Exploratory Data Analysis on Haberman Cancer Survival Status Dataset to predict the survival status of a patient based on various dimensions
Extracted data into Pandas Data Frame from a .csv file.
Performed basic statistical analysis using Pandas functions like describe, shape, columns, value_counts, head, tail etc.
Done some basic data cleaning for data readability.
Our objective is to find whether there is relation between given features 'age', 'year', 'nodes' and survival period of patients. If there is relation, we must find out which feature/features best predicts the survival period.
Used matplotlib and seaborn libraries to plot various graphs like 2-D scatter plots, pair plots, 1-D scatter plots, PDF, CDF, Box plots, Violin plots to find the relationship between dependent and independent variables.
Calculated statistical parameters like Mean, Standard Deviation, Median, Percentiles, Inter Quartile Range (IQR) to find out the right variable(s) that predicts the survival status.
